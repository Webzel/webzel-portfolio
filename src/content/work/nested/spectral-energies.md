Spectral Energies is an R&D company that provides advanced combustion diagnostics and engineering services. They needed a clean, accessible website that clearly communicated their services, expertise, and government research capabilities.

I was responsible for wireframing the site‚Äôs structure based on early client and stakeholder discussions, then developing the site in WordPress after receiving high-fidelity designs from our in-house design team.

##### 1. Wireframing & Information Architecture

My role began with understanding the client‚Äôs goals and the technical nature of their services. Based on early discovery meetings and internal briefs, I created wireframes to establish a clear content hierarchy, call-to-action placement, and page structure. These wireframes served as a blueprint for both the design and development phases, ensuring that key information ‚Äî like core capabilities, research areas, and government affiliations ‚Äî was prominently and logically presented.

The goal at this stage was to simplify a complex subject matter and translate it into an intuitive user experience. I paid particular attention to usability and content flow, especially on key pages like the homepage, Capabilities, and About sections.

##### 2. Design Handoff & Collaboration

Once the wireframes were approved, I collaborated with the design team to provide context and guidance on layout priorities, functionality, and user behavior expectations. Our designer used the wireframes as a starting point to develop high-fidelity visuals in Figma, which reflected the brand‚Äôs professional and research-oriented identity. I worked closely with them to ensure that the final designs were not only visually strong but also realistic and development-friendly.

##### 3. WordPress Development

I developed the site using a lightweight, flexible WordPress theme that allowed for both performance and content manageability. Key development highlights include:

- Custom page templates for modular sections (team bios, capabilities, contact forms)
- Mobile responsiveness and accessibility improvements
- Clean HTML structure with semantic markup for SEO
- Performance optimization through image compression and minimal plugin use

I also implemented backend flexibility so the client could easily manage updates without needing a developer for every change ‚Äî especially important for a site that includes team updates and research developments.

##### ‚úÖ Outcome

The final website successfully communicates Spectral Energies' capabilities to their government, academic, and industry partners. The structure and design emphasize clarity and professionalism while remaining easy to navigate, even for visitors unfamiliar with technical research.

The development process was completed on time and within scope, and the internal team was highly satisfied with the outcome. The client is now able to maintain their content independently thanks to a clean admin experience and flexible content blocks.
