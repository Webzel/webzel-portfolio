##### Pok√©mon Team Builder

**Project Type:** Personal / Learning Project  
**Tech Stack:** Astro, TypeScript, Vanilla JavaScript, Pok√©API, LocalStorage

##### Overview

The Pok√©mon Team Builder is a web application that helps users build their ideal team of Pok√©mon using real-time data from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/). It‚Äôs designed to make team planning simple, fun, and informative for casual fans and strategists alike.

This project is an **ongoing build** meant to showcase my full-stack JavaScript skills, particularly with Astro and clean front-end UX. It also reflects my passion for interactive, data-driven interfaces.
