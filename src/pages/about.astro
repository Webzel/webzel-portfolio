					<p>
						Hi, I’m a web developer based in Dayton, Ohio with a passion for crafting clean, effective 
						websites that make life easier for both clients and users. I have an associate degree in 
						Software Development from Sinclair Community College, but my journey into tech was anything but 
						traditional—I spent several years as a tattoo artist, traveling the country and building 
						a national client base through conventions and word of mouth.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						For the past three years, I’ve focused on building websites for small to medium-sized businesses. 
						I specialize in WordPress—using a flexible theme I’ve refined over time—and also work with Astro 
						and custom JavaScript to create fast, modern web experiences. My work often includes e-commerce 
						and content-focused sites that are both functional and easy to manage.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Clients often tell me they enjoy working with me because I listen closely, respond quickly, 
						and make the process smooth and stress-free. I take pride in making each project feel personal and prioritized.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Outside of tech, I’m detail-oriented, collaborative, and always eager to keep learning. 
						I bring the same care and focus to my work that I once brought to every tattoo—and I think it shows.
